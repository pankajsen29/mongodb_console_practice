# mongodb_console_practice

## This repository contains practice code for connecting to MongoDB from Console .NET core application.

This is done as part of my own learning.
The source of the code is written by me, but are learnt from various online articles and videos. 
Therefore resemblance to others' code is quite possible. Feel free to feedback.
